# STL Generator

C project that generates STL files with various shapes.

As of now, the program will generate two files, "fractals.stl" and "spheres.stl" which each contain 6 fractals or spheres of increasing granularity.

I plan to implement the ability to allow a user to pass in a shape name, size, and depth (for fractals) via the commandline so that the source code doesn't need to be modified in order to generate different shapes

## How to use

clone this repository

```make```

```./generator```

clear executables with

```make clean```
